# AJAX-Getting-data-from-php-file
- Using AJAX to fetch data from a php file with button click
- This is another project I had for University of Athens with AJAX.
- With click you fetch data from php file according to what you clicked .
- The data you fetch is displayed in the screen .
- Don't forget since AJAX takes data from server you need a server emulation like XAMPP or real server.
